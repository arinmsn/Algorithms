function maxStockProfit(pricesArr){
    // Takes in an array of prcies for a stock
    // as a parameter and results hte max possible
    // profit of the day (we could have made)

    // What is the best price to sell & best price to buy
}

Example: [ 40, 38, 36, 12, 15, 8, 10, 30, 60, 160]
Maximum profit we could have made is $174.
Since 8 is best price we could buy and 160 is best price to sell

Notes: If no profit is possible for that day, return -1.  
A max profit of 0 is treated as any other max profit value
O(n) -linear- is the one we are aiming for
