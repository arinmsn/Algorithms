/*

  * Collection of elements identified by index or key
  *  An array just contains a linear set of values, which is often called a one-dimensional array.
  * Element positions can be calculated using a mathematical expression.
  * We can directly access array elements in what is called a "random access fashion."
  For example, since in most programming languages the index of the first element is zero,
  we can use a formula like the, following to retrieve even-numbered elements:
      even_elem = array[2n]
  
  Array Operations:
  
    - Calculate item index: O(1)
    - Insert or delete item at beginning: O(n)
    - Insert or delete item in middle: O(n)
    - Insert or delete item at end: O(1)
