 A stack is a collection of elements that supports two principle operations,
 push and pop. Stacks are last-in, first-out data structures. In other words,
 the last item pushed is the first one popped. So if we had a stack with one
 item in it and we pushed another item onto the stack, followed by another,
 we'd have a stack with three items in it.
 
 Pushing an item onto the stack is constan-time operation
 
 
 Queues work  a little differently.
